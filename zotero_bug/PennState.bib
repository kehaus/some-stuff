We demonstrate that beam interruption of the metal source enables the growth of crystalline WTe 2 films in the distorted octahedral (1T') phase. As a result of the van der Waals nature of this material, a sharp interface between the WTe 2 thin film and the substrate is shown with no evidence of misfit dislocations. In addition, the buckled structure expected for the semi-metallic 1T' phase is observed with transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy further confirms the growth of the 1T' phase and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the films to be stoichiometric and semi-metallic as expected.},

	abstract = {Heating up the quantum spin Hall effect
Taking practical advantage of the topologically protected conducting edge states of topological insulators (TIs) has proven difficult. Semiconductor systems that have been identified as two-dimensional TIs must be cooled down to near liquid helium temperatures to bring out their topological character. Wu et al. fabricated a heterostructure consisting of a monolayer of WTe2 placed between two layers of hexagonal boron nitride and found that its topological properties persisted up to a relatively high temperature of 100 K. Engineering this so-called quantum spin Hall effect in a van der Waals heterostructure makes it possible to apply many established experimental tools and functionalities.
Science, this issue p. 76
A variety of monolayer crystals have been proposed to be two-dimensional topological insulators exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), possibly even at high temperatures. Here we report the observation of the QSHE in monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) at temperatures up to 100 kelvin. In the short-edge limit, the monolayer exhibits the hallmark transport conductance, {\textasciitilde}e2/h per edge, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck{\textquoteright}s constant. Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering. Our results establish the QSHE at temperatures much higher than in semiconductor heterostructures and allow for exploring topological phases in atomically thin crystals.
Transport measurements show that the monolayer of WTe2 has helical edge modes at elevated temperatures.

No monolayer material has yet been shown to be a 2DTI, but recently the Weyl semimetal WTe2 was predicted12 to become a 2DTI in monolayer form if a bulk gap opens. Here, we report that, at temperatures below about 100 K, monolayer WTe2 does become insulating in its interior, while the edges still conduct. The edge conduction is strongly suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and is independent of gate voltage, save for mesoscopic fluctuations that grow on cooling due to a zero-bias anomaly, which reduces the linear-response conductance. Bilayer WTe2 also becomes insulating at low temperatures but does not show edge conduction. Many of these observations are consistent with monolayer WTe2 being a 2DTI. However, the low-temperature edge conductance, for contacts spacings down to 150 nm, never reaches values higher than \~{}20 $\mu$S, about half the predicted value of e2/h, suggesting significant elastic scattering in the edge.},

In bulk NbSe2 a CDW sets in at TCDW = 33 K and superconductivity sets in at Tc = 7.2 K. Below Tc these electronic states coexist but their microscopic formation mechanisms remain controversial. Here we present an electronic characterization study of a single two-dimensional (2D) layer of NbSe2 by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate that 3 {\texttimes} 3 CDW order in NbSe2 remains intact in two dimensions. Superconductivity also still remains in the 2D limit, but its onset temperature is depressed to 1.9 K. Our STS measurements at 5 K reveal a CDW gap of $\Delta$ = 4 meV at the Fermi energy, which is accessible by means of STS owing to the removal of bands crossing the Fermi level for a single layer. Our observations are consistent with the simplified (compared to bulk) electronic structure of single-layer NbSe2, thus providing insight into CDW formation and superconductivity in this model strongly correlated system.},

The lattice-matching condition, however, has been found to be drastically relaxed when the epitaxial growth proceeds with van der Waals interactions. Many kinds of layered material are suitable for that purpose. They are easily cleaved along the layers without producing dangling bonds on their cleaved surfaces. The epitaxial growth of a layered material onto those surfaces proceeds with a van der Waals force, resulting in good heteroepitaxial growth even with a large lattice mismatch between the grown and the substrate materials. It has also been found that van der Waals epitaxy can be applied to the epitaxial growth of a layered material on an ordinary three-dimensional material substrate, if regular termination of the surface dangling bonds is accomplished. Sulphur or selenium-atom-terminated GaAs(111), H-atom-terminated Si(111) and F-atom-terminated CaF2(111) surfaces can be used for that purpose. van der Waals epitaxy has also been successfully applied to grow such organic molecular crystal films as metal phthalocyanines, higher aromatics and C60.},

The layered semimetal tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) has recently been found to be a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) when thinned down to a single monolayer, with conducting helical edge channels. We found that intrinsic superconductivity can be induced in this monolayer 2D TI by mild electrostatic doping at temperatures below 1 kelvin. The 2D TI{\textendash}superconductor transition can be driven by applying a small gate voltage. This discovery offers possibilities for gate-controlled devices combining superconductivity and nontrivial topological properties, and could provide a basis for quantum information schemes based on topological protection.

	abstract = {Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect materials feature edge states that are topologically protected from backscattering. However, the small band gap in materials that have been identified as QSH insulators limits applications. We use first-principles calculations to predict a class of large-gap QSH insulators in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with 1T' structure, namely, 1T'-MX2 with M = (tungsten or molybdenum) and X = (tellurium, selenium, or sulfur). A structural distortion causes an intrinsic band inversion between chalcogenide-p and metal-d bands. Additionally, spin-orbit coupling opens a gap that is tunable by vertical electric field and strain. We propose a topological field effect transistor made of van der Waals heterostructures of 1T'-MX2 and two-dimensional dielectric layers that can be rapidly switched off by electric field through a topological phase transition instead of carrier depletion.
Predicting an exotic state of matter
Much like graphene, twodimensional flakes of transition metal dichalcogenides have appealing electronic properties. Qian et al. now find that certain structures of these materials may also exhibit the so-called spin Hall effect. The spin Hall effect represents an exotic state of matter in which a 2D material conducts electricity along its edge in a way that drastically reduces dissipation. To show this, the researchers used first-principle calculations and found that the materials also feature a large band gap, which reduces undesirable conduction through the bulk. Their proposed device could be switched on and off quickly using an electric field.

The Weyl semimetal phase realized in the TaAs class of materials features multiple Fermi arcs arising from topological surface states10,11,14,15,16 and exhibits novel quantum phenomena, such as a chiral anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance17,18,19 and possibly emergent supersymmetry20. Recently it was proposed theoretically that a new type (type-II) of Weyl fermion21,22 that arises due to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, which does not have a counterpart in high-energy physics, can emerge as topologically protected touching between electron and hole pockets. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of topological Fermi arcs in the predicted type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2 (refs 23,24,25). The topological surface states are confirmed by directly observing the surface states using bulk- and surface-sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and the quasi-particle interference pattern between the putative topological Fermi arcs in scanning tunnelling microscopy. By establishing MoTe2 as an experimental realization of a type-II Weyl semimetal, our work opens up opportunities for probing the physical properties of this exciting new state.},

	abstract = {The search for proximity-induced superconductivity in topological materials has generated widespread interest in the condensed matter physics community. The superconducting states inheriting nontrivial topology at interfaces are expected to exhibit exotic phenomena such as topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes, which hold promise for applications in quantum computation. However, a practical realization of such hybrid structures based on topological semimetals and superconductors has hitherto been limited. Here, we report the strong proximity-induced superconductivity in type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2, in a van der Waals hybrid structure obtained by mechanically transferring NbSe2 onto various thicknesses of WTe2. When the WTe2 thickness (tWTe2) reaches 21 nm, the superconducting transition occurs around the critical temperature (Tc) of NbSe2 with a gap amplitude ($\Delta$p) of 0.38 meV and an unexpected ultralong proximity length (lp) up to 7 $\mu$m. With the thicker 42 nm WTe2 layer, however, the proximity effect yields Tc ? 1.2 K, $\Delta$p = 0.07 meV, and a short lp of less than 1 $\mu$m. Our theoretical calculations, based on the Bogoliubov{\textendash}de Gennes equations in the clean limit, predict that the induced superconducting gap is a sizable fraction of the NbSe2 superconducting one when tWTe2 is less than 30 nm and then decreases quickly as tWTe2 increases. This agrees qualitatively well with the experiments. Such observations form a basis in the search for superconducting phases in topological semimetals.},

While realizing intrinsic superconductivity has been challenging in the type II Weyl semi-metal WTe2, the proximity effect may open an avenue for the realization of superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of proximity-induced superconductivity with a long coherence length along the c axis in WTe2 thin flakes based on a WTe2/NbSe2 van der Waals heterostructure. Interestingly, we also observe anomalous oscillations of the differential resistance during the transition from the superconducting to the normal state. Theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with experimental results, revealing that such a subgap anomaly is the intrinsic property of WTe2 in superconducting state induced by the proximity effect. Our findings enrich the understanding of the superconducting phase of type II Weyl semi-metals and pave the way for their future applications in topological quantum computing.},

Both the charge density wave and the superconducting phase have been observed down to the monolayer limit. The superconducting transition temperature decreases on lowering the layer thickness, but the newly observed charge-density-wave transition temperature increases from 33 K in the bulk to 145 K in the monolayer. Such highly unusual enhancement of charge density waves in atomically thin samples can be understood to be a result of significantly enhanced electron{\textendash}phonon interactions in two-dimensional NbSe2 (ref. 4) and is supported by the large blueshift of the collective amplitude vibration observed in our experiment.

Here we report the phase diagram for an FeSe monolayer grown on a SrTiO3 substrate, by tuning the charge carrier concentration over a wide range through an extensive annealing procedure. We identify two distinct phases that compete during the annealing process: the electronic structure of the phase at low doping (N phase) bears a clear resemblance to the antiferromagnetic parent compound of the Fe-based superconductors, whereas the superconducting phase (S phase) emerges with the increase in doping and the suppression of the N phase. By optimizing the carrier concentration, we observe strong indications of superconductivity with a transition temperature of 65{\textpm}5 K. The wide tunability of the system across different phases makes the FeSe monolayer ideal for investigating not only the physics of superconductivity, but also for studying novel quantum phenomena more generally.},

Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review paper highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic {\textquoteleft}topological{\textquoteright} one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to {\textquoteleft}engineer{\textquoteright} such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions{\textemdash}the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

Significantly larger gaps and higher transition temperatures in cuprate superconductors might be an attractive alternative to considerably relax these constraints, but it is not clear whether the proximity effect would be effective in heterostructures involving cuprates and topological insulators. Here, we present angle-resolved photoemission studies of thin Bi2Se3 films grown in situ on optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$ substrates that show the absence of proximity-induced gaps on the surfaces of Bi2Se3 films as thin as a 1.5 quintuple layer.

Nearly 80 years ago, the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana proposed the existence of an unusual type of particle that is its own antiparticle, the so-called Majorana fermion. The search for a free Majorana fermion has so far been unsuccessful, but bound Majorana-like collective excitations may exist in certain exotic superconductors. Nadj-Perge et al. created such a topological superconductor by depositing iron atoms onto the surface of superconducting lead, forming atomic chains (see the Perspective by Lee). They then used a scanning tunneling microscope to observe enhanced conductance at the ends of these chains at zero energy, where theory predicts Majorana states should appear.
Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 547
Majorana fermions are predicted to localize at the edge of a topological superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron (Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic chains.
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to observe signatures of Majorana states at the ends of iron atom chains. [Also see Perspective by Lee]

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb{\textendash}InSb nanowire{\textendash}Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap $\Delta$InSb \~{} 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is Ez \~{} $\Delta$InSb, is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.},

Although Majorana fermions remain elusive as elementary particles, their solid-state analogs have been observed in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires. In a nanowire setting, the Majorana states are localized at the ends of the wire. He et al. built a two-dimensional heterostructure in which a one-dimensional Majorana mode is predicted to run along the sample edge (see the Perspective by Pribiag). The heterostructure consisted of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) bar contacted by a superconductor. The authors used an external magnetic field as a {\textquotedblleft}knob{\textquotedblright} to tune into a regime where a Majorana mode was propagating along the edge of the QAHI bar covered by the superconductor. A signature of this propagation{\textemdash}half-quantized conductance{\textemdash}was then observed in transport experiments.
Science, this issue p. 294; see also p. 252
Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.
Transport experiments showing half-integer quantized conductance indicate a propagating Majorana edge mode.

	abstract = {Ultrathin freestanding bismuth film is theoretically predicted to be one kind of two-dimensional topological insulators. Experimentally, the topological nature of bismuth strongly depends on the situations of the Bi films. Film thickness and interaction with the substrate often change the topological properties of Bi films. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy and first-principle calculation, the properties of Bi(111) ultrathin film grown on the NbSe2 superconducting substrate have been studied. We find the band structures of the ultrathin film is quasi-freestanding, and one-dimensional edge state exists on Bi(111) film as thin as three bilayers. Superconductivity is also detected on different layers of the film and the pairing potential exhibits an exponential decay with the layer thicknesses. Thus, the topological edge state can coexist with superconductivity, which makes the system a promising platform for exploring Majorana Fermions.},

	abstract = {Strongly correlated topological surface states are promising platforms for next-generation quantum applications, but they remain elusive in real materials. The correlated Kondo insulator SmB\$\_6\$ is one of the most promising candidates, with theoretically predicted heavy Dirac surface states supported by transport and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. However, a puzzling discrepancy appears between STM and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments on SmB\$\_6\$. Although ARPES detects spin-textured surface states, their velocity is an order of magnitude higher than expected, while the Dirac point -- the hallmark of any topological system -- can only be inferred deep within the bulk valence band. A significant challenge is that SmB\$\_6\$ lacks a natural cleavage plane, resulting in ordered surface domains limited to 10s of nanometers. Here we use STM to show that surface band bending can shift energy features by 10s of meV between domains. Starting from our STM spectra, we simulate the full spectral function as an average over multiple domains with different surface potentials. Our simulation shows excellent agreement with ARPES data, and thus resolves the apparent discrepancy between large-area measurements that average over multiple band-shifted domains and atomically-resolved measurements within a single domain.},

	abstract = {Interfaces between correlated complex oxides are promising avenues to realize new forms of magnetism that arise as a result of charge transfer, proximity effects, and locally broken symmetries. We report on the discovery of a noncollinear magnetic structure in superlattices of the ferromagnetic metallic oxide La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) and the correlated metal LaNiO3 (LNO). The exchange interaction between LSMO layers is mediated by the intervening LNO, such that the angle between the magnetization of neighboring LSMO layers varies in an oscillatory manner with the thickness of the LNO layer. The magnetic field, temperature, and spacer thickness dependence of the noncollinear structure are inconsistent with the bilinear and biquadratic interactions that are used to model the magnetic structure in conventional metallic multilayers. A model that couples the LSMO layers to a helical spin state within the LNO fits the observed behavior. We propose that the spin-helix results from the interaction between a spatially varying spin susceptibility within the LNO and interfacial charge transfer that creates localized Ni2+ states. Our work suggests a new approach to engineering noncollinear spin textures in metallic oxide heterostructures.},

	abstract = {The de Gennes extrapolation length is a direction dependent measure of the spatial evolution of the pairing gap near the boundary of a superconductor, and thus provides a viable means to probe its symmetry. It is expected to be infinite and isotropic for plain s-wave pairing, and finite and anisotropic for d-wave. Here, we synthesize single layer FeSe films on SrTiO3(001) (STO) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy, and measure the de Gennes extrapolation length by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We find a 40\% reduction of the superconducting gap near specular [110]Fe edges, yielding an extrapolation length of 8.0 nm. However, near specular [010]Fe edges the extrapolation length is nearly infinite. These findings are consistent with a phase changing pairing with 2-fold symmetry, indicating d-wave superconductivity. This is further supported by the presence of in-gap states near the specular [110]Fe edges, but not the [010]Fe edges. This work provides direct experimental evidence for d-wave superconductivity in single layer FeSe/STO, and demonstrates quasiparticle scattering at boundaries to be a viable phase sensitive probe of pairing symmetry in Fe-based superconductors.},
